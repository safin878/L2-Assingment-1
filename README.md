## ðŸŽ¯ TypeScript for Beginners: Interfaces vs Types & What the Heck is `keyof`?

If youâ€™re just diving into TypeScript, you might be scratching your head over some of its features. Trust me, Iâ€™ve been there. Two things that confused me at first were the difference between `interface` and `type`, and what `keyof` is even used for. So in this blog, Iâ€™ll break these down in plain English (and a bit of code, of course).

### ðŸ’¡ Interfaces vs Types in TypeScript â€” What's the Difference?

At first glance, `interface` and `type` seem to do the same thing â€” they both let you define the shape of an object.

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

 <pre>
// Using interface
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Using type
type UserType = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
</pre>


## ðŸ”‘ What is the use of the `keyof` keyword in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, the `keyof` keyword is used to **get all the property names (keys)** of an object **as a union type**.

### ðŸ“Œ Basic Example

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type UserKeys = keyof User;
// Result: "name" | "age"
